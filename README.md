# Image-Classification-of-Concrete-Crack
The dataset is taken from https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/files/8a70d8a5-bce9-4291-bab9-b48cfb3e87c3/file_downloaded
In this project, I have manually split the dataset into train and test data where the test data consist of each 3000 image data from Positive and Negative data respectively.

Based on the result of the performance model on the loss and accuracy graph, the model shows a very good result of 99.80% of accuracy and 0.51% of loss. 
Transfer learning is used for the modelling with learning_rate = 0.0001. Fine tune model can also be apply to increase the model accuracy but make sure its not too overfit.
